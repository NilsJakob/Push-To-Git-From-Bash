win + s type: Git

choose git bash

gets you to MINGW64:/c/Users/nilsjj12

cd .. to change directory, untill you are at the local directory from where to push from,

and then clone

git clone and put in url from github

so
cd Documents
cd Present
cd PushToGit
cd Push-To-Git-From-Bash

The terminal will look something like this:
UIA+nilsjj12@UIAA106502B MINGW64 ~/Documents/Present/PushToGit/push-to-git-from-bash (master)

If you have any images or files in repo, then:
git pull origin master

then:
git status
git add 'filename'
git commit 'message'
git push origin master

If you then want to make changes do it in a new branch:
git branch 'nameofbranch'

This creates a new branch from where you can pull, add, commit and push

if branch is up to date then this message wil appear:
'From https://github.com/NilsJakob/Push-To-Git-From-Bash
 * branch            pushpull   -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.'



then 
git status
git add 'filename'
git commit -m 'commit_message'
git push origin 'branchname'
